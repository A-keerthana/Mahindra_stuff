# Mahindra Test Track Monitoring System  

## Overview  

This project is designed to monitor cars on Mahindra’s 450-acre test track using real-time object detection, tracking, and annotation. The system integrates multiple camera feeds, detects vehicles, tracks their speed and stability, and provides real-time analytics via a dashboard.  

## Features  

- **Multi-Camera Integration**: Aggregates multiple RTSP/HTTP feeds and displays them in a grid layout.  
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Uses YOLO (v5/v7/v8) to detect cars from live feeds.  
- **Vehicle Tracking & Annotation**: Captures speed, angle, and skid events.  
- **Collision & Parking Alerts**: Identifies potential crashes and parking events.  
- **Dashboard & Data Visualization**: Displays real-time data for monitoring.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO (v5/v7/v8), TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- **Backend**: Flask/Django  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, WebSockets, Socket.IO  
- **Real-Time Processing**: GStreamer, FFmpeg  
- **Model Optimization**: TensorRT, ONNX  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/alikhan37544/Mahindra_stuff.git  
   cd Mahindra_stuff  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Run the object detection model:  
   ```bash  
   python detect.py  
   ```  

4. Launch the dashboard:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

## Project Phases  

### 1. System Setup  
- Aggregate camera feeds into a single monitor.  
- Use OpenCV/GStreamer for handling real-time feeds.  

### 2. Car Detection & Annotation  
- Implement YOLO-based object detection.  
- Display bounding boxes and labels (e.g., speed, car type).  

### 3. Vehicle-Specific Data Extraction  
- Track speed using frame-by-frame movement analysis.  
- Detect angle deviations for stability assessment.  
- Identify skid marks and wheelbase variations.  

### 4. Collision & Parking Alerts  
- Detect proximity violations and potential collisions.  
- Monitor vehicle movement to determine parking events.  

### 5. Data Processing & Dashboard  
- Build a real-time web dashboard for tracking test data.  
- Implement recording and playback of annotated footage.  

## Future Enhancements  

- **Model Optimization**: Improve inference time using TensorRT.  
- **Sensor Integration**: Use accelerometer/gyroscope for better skid analysis.  
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement ML-based behavior prediction.
