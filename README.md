Mahindra Test Track Monitoring System

Overview

This project is designed to monitor cars on Mahindra’s 450-acre test track using real-time object detection, tracking, and annotation. The system integrates multiple camera feeds, detects vehicles, tracks their speed and stability, and provides real-time analytics via a dashboard.

Features

Multi-Camera Integration: Aggregates multiple RTSP/HTTP feeds and displays them in a grid layout.
Real-Time Object Detection: Uses YOLO (v5/v7/v8) to detect cars from live feeds.
Vehicle Tracking & Annotation: Captures speed, angle, and skid events.
Collision & Parking Alerts: Identifies potential crashes and parking events.
Dashboard & Data Visualization: Displays real-time data for monitoring.
Technologies Used

Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLO (v5/v7/v8), TensorFlow/PyTorch
Backend: Flask/Django
Frontend: JavaScript, WebSockets, Socket.IO
Real-Time Processing: GStreamer, FFmpeg
Model Optimization: TensorRT, ONNX

Project Phases

1. System Setup
Aggregate camera feeds into a single monitor.
Use OpenCV/GStreamer for handling real-time feeds.
2. Car Detection & Annotation
Implement YOLO-based object detection.
Display bounding boxes and labels (e.g., speed, car type).
3. Vehicle-Specific Data Extraction
Track speed using frame-by-frame movement analysis.
Detect angle deviations for stability assessment.
Identify skid marks and wheelbase variations.
4. Collision & Parking Alerts
Detect proximity violations and potential collisions.
Monitor vehicle movement to determine parking events.
5. Data Processing & Dashboard
Build a real-time web dashboard for tracking test data.
Implement recording and playback of annotated footage.
Future Enhancements

Model Optimization: Improve inference time using TensorRT.
Sensor Integration: Use accelerometer/gyroscope for better skid analysis.
Advanced Analytics: Implement ML-based behavior prediction.
